# Botfly

An enhanced debugger that uses prompt-toolkit.


You can also import the `botfly.debugger` module in your code and call the
`post_mortem` function, as with *pdb*.

Some notable features:

* Colorized UI - stacktrace, prompt, etc.
* More informative reports, prompt shows current position in stack.
* Invoke your editor at current point.
* REPL-like evaluator
* Enter sub-REPL if desired.
* Display opcodes.
